### Introduction
This project is developed as a homework for course which is named as "React Native ile Mobile App PatikasÄ±" in Turkish and which is held by <a href="https://www.patika.dev/">Patika</a>. Purpose of this project is to develop a <i>Todo App.</i>

### About project and conclusion
This project is starter level <b>React Native</b> project and functionality of this project is add some entry as a task into list a show them in custom component (Its very primitive and pink).

List of added entries (task) is kept into an array which is used as <b>state.</b> So that, if program is closed and opened or restarted, all of list items can not be accessed, data is kept on random memory (I think so). 

Deleting of the Todo list items can be performed as long pressing onto task item (pink rectangle box). After long pressing onto pink box, an alert is prompted to screen and it contains Cancel and Ok buttons. By clicking OK button, deleting transaction can be performed. Indeed, essence of the project depends on state data flow management.

I gained some abilities after this project and this is my first serious project on mobile. It was funny and extremely educative project development process. So that, I want to thanks to <a href="https://www.patika.dev/">Patika</a>.
